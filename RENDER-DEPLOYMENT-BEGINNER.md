## ðŸŽ¯ STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT (15 minutes total)

### **STEP 1: Create Render Account (3 minutes)**

1. **Open your web browser** and go to: [render.com](https://render.com)

2. **Click "Get Started for Free"** (big button on the homepage)

3. **Sign up with GitHub:**
   - Click "Sign up with GitHub" 
   - It will ask to authorize Render to access your GitHub
   - Click "Authorize Render"
   - You'll be redirected back to Render

4. **You're now logged into Render!** You should see a dashboard.

---

### **STEP 2: Create PostgreSQL Database (3 minutes)**

**Why we need this:** Your app needs a database to store user accounts and API keys.

1. **In your Render dashboard**, click the **"New +"** button (top right)

2. **Select "PostgreSQL"** from the dropdown menu

3. **Fill in the database details:**
   - **Name**: `reddit-scout-db`
   - **Database**: `reddit_scout` 
   - **User**: `reddit_scout_user`
   - **Region**: Leave as default (US East)
   - **PostgreSQL Version**: Leave as default (latest)
   - **Plan**: Select **"Free"** ($0/month - perfect for testing)

4. **Click "Create Database"**

5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for database creation. You'll see a green "Available" status when ready.

6. **IMPORTANT: Keep this tab open** - we'll need the database connection info later.

---

### **STEP 3: Create Web Service (5 minutes)**

**This is where your app will actually run.**

1. **Click the "New +" button** again (top right)

2. **Select "Web Service"** from the dropdown

3. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - Click "Connect account" if you haven't already
   - You should see your repositories listed
   - Find and click **"Reddit-Scout-Pro-v2"** 
   - Click **"Connect"**

4. **Configure your web service:**
   - **Name**: `reddit-scout-pro-community` (or whatever you prefer)
   - **Region**: Leave as default (US East)
   - **Branch**: `main` (should be auto-selected)
   - **Runtime**: Should auto-detect as **"Python"** âœ…
   - **Build Command**: Should auto-fill as `pip install -r requirements.txt` âœ…
   - **Start Command**: Should auto-fill as `python start.py` âœ…

5. **Choose your plan:**
   - Select **"Free"** ($0/month) for testing
   - Note: Free tier sleeps after 15 min of inactivity (perfect for testing)
   - You can upgrade later if needed

6. **Don't click "Create Web Service" yet!** We need to add environment variables first.

---

### **STEP 4: Add Environment Variables (2 minutes)**

**These are secret configuration values your app needs.**

1. **Scroll down** to the "Environment Variables" section (still on the same page)

2. **Click "Add Environment Variable"** and add these **exactly**:

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Key**: `SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value**: `reddit-scout-pro-community-secret-key-2024-super-secure`

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Key**: `ENCRYPTION_KEY` 
   - **Value**: `jwlCDTjTG90vw--ZZEFXyjuPbLZkaf_sSf0NbIZ28mY=` (use the key from your local tests)

   **Variable 3:**
   - **Key**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: We need to get this from your database...

3. **To get DATABASE_URL:**
   - **Go back to your database tab** (from Step 2)
   - **Click on your database name** (`reddit-scout-db`)
   - **Look for "External Database URL"** or "Connection String"
   - **Copy the entire URL** (starts with `postgresql://`)
   - **Paste it as the value** for DATABASE_URL

4. **Your environment variables should look like:**
   ```
   SECRET_KEY = reddit-scout-pro-community-secret-key-2024-super-secure
   ENCRYPTION_KEY = jwlCDTjTG90vw--ZZEFXyjuPbLZkaf_sSf0NbIZ28mY=
   DATABASE_URL = postgresql://reddit_scout_user:password@dpg-xxx.oregon-postgres.render.com/reddit_scout
   ```

5. **Now click "Create Web Service"**

---

### **STEP 5: Wait for Deployment (5 minutes)**

**Render will now build and deploy your app automatically.**
